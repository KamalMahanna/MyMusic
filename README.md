## 🚀 Key Features

* **🎵 High-Quality Online Streaming:** Discover and stream millions of tracks, albums, playlists, and artists in high resolution via integrated [API client](app/src/main/java/com/mymusic/app/data/api/SaavnApi.kt).
* **📻 System-Integrated Playback:** A foreground audio service built on **AndroidX Media3 (ExoPlayer & MediaSession)**, supporting lock screen media controls, background playback, system notification integration, and audio focus handling. Implemented in [MusicService](app/src/main/java/com/mymusic/app/player/MusicService.kt) and [MusicPlayerManager](app/src/main/java/com/mymusic/app/player/MusicPlayerManager.kt).
* **📥 Offline Downloads:** High-speed song downloader ([SongDownloader](app/src/main/java/com/mymusic/app/download/SongDownloader.kt)) that saves files directly to the public `Music/MyMusic` directory, allowing other players to index downloaded music and supporting local playback via [DownloadRepository](app/src/main/java/com/mymusic/app/data/repository/DownloadRepository.kt).
* **🔀 Smart Queue & Playback Management:** Queue persistence, shuffle, repeat-one, repeat-all, and smooth seek features, managed efficiently via [QueueManager](app/src/main/java/com/mymusic/app/player/QueueManager.kt).
* **⚡ Smart Offline Cache:** Reduces network consumption for streaming by utilizing custom network caching policies on OkHttp, along with a dedicated [StreamingCacheManager](app/src/main/java/com/mymusic/app/player/StreamingCacheManager.kt).
* **🎨 Responsive Jetpack Compose UI:** Premium design with glassmorphism, dynamic animations, modern color schemes, and seamless layout transitions.
* **📱 Adaptive Layouts:** Adapts to multiple screen form factors: uses a bottom navigation bar on phones and an elegant navigation rail on tablets or foldables ([NavGraph.kt](app/src/main/java/com/mymusic/app/ui/navigation/NavGraph.kt)).
